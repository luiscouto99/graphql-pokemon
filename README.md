# Experimenting with GraphQL.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary:

This project was developed with ReactJS, and also with Apollo Server so that I could experiment with a GraphQL based API. I used an [existing Pokemon API](https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/).

***

*Feel free to deploy the project using the following workflow:*
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luiscouto99/graphql-pokemon.git
$ npm install
$ cd graphql-pokemon
$ npm start
```

## Implementations:

- React.js (w/ hooks)
- Apollo Server
- GraphQL (w/ filter requests)
- Typescript
- Styled-Components
- Responsiveness (fit for mobile, tablet and desktop)
